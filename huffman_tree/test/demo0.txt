Passage 4. A Little GirlSitting on a grassy grave, beneath one of the windows of the church, was a little girl.With her head bent back she was gazing up at the sky and singing,while one of her little hands was pointing to a tiny cloudthat hovered like a golden feather above her head.The sun, which had suddenly become very bright, shining on her glossy hair,gave it a metallic luster, and it was difficult to say what was the color, dark bronze or black.So completely absorbed was she in watching the cloud to which her strange song or incantation seemed addressed,that she did not observe me when I rose and went towards her.Over her head, high up in the blue,a lark that was soaring towards the same gauzy cloud was singing, as if in rivalry.As I slowly approached the child,I could see by her forehead, which in the sunshine seemed like a globe of pearl,and especially by her complexion, that she uncommonly lovely.Her eyes, which at one moment seemed blue-gray, at another violet,were shaded by long black lashes, curving backward in a most peculiar way,and these matched in hue her eyebrows,and the tresses that were tossed about her tender throat were quivering in the sunlight.Passage 4.
